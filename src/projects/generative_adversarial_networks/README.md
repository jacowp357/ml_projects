Facial Keypoint Detection
=========================

Each file can be run by executing the script in Python 3. Hyperparamaters can be changed and the model renamed with each test. This was just an exercise to get familiar with Theano and a few gradient decent optimisation techniques, and not an attempt to beat benchmark models. The data can be downloaded from the Kaggle website here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection

Usage
=====

Execute one of the following files depending on what model you would like to test:

    - facial_keypoint_detection.py contains multilayer perceptron code.
    - facial_keypoint_detection_conv_net.py contains convolutional layer code.
