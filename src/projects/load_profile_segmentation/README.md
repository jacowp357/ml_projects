Daily energy load profile segmentation
======================================

The aim of this project was to segement daily energy load profiles to understand the primary daily load characteristics and the geographical area they fall under.

Usage
=====

There are three main parts to this projects:

- cluster.py (main code with euclidean distance metric)
- cluster_dtw.py (code with dynamic time warping distance metric)
- clusterinitialisation.py (non-uniform binary split algorithm for cluster initialisation)
