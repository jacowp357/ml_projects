ml_projects
===========

This is where I keep and share some of my ml projects. I'm currently doing research on generative models: `Generative adversarial networks` (GANs) and `Latent dirichlet allocation` (LDA) that can be incorporated in  a `Probabilistic graphical model` (PGM) framework with application to a specific field of interest. I will be sharing these initiatives as my research progress.

Dependencies
============

Most of my projects work with `Python 3` or higher (generally I try to keep up with the latest versions). Requirements are the same as for the following main packages:

- `sklearn`
- `theano`
- `tensorflow` 
- `pgmpy`
- `libpgm`

Download
========

I provide links to where the data can be downloaded to run/test the models on the same data. I try to avoid sharing data in the repository.

Usage
=====

For most of my project, the code can be executed by running the `.py` files (from within each project folder) from the command-line or from within Sublime. For the imports pointing to modules used in ml_projects to work, a Python path to the src directory should be added follows:

`PYTHONPATH=~/your_path_here/ml_projects/src`
